  <h1>On `anfive`</h1>
  <p>
    `anfive` was written after `five` had been completed, so I had an idea that there might be potential limitations regarding what Google 
    allows apps to do. Jetpack Compose maps nicely to SwiftUI and vice versa, so having everything laid out in one project made a rewrite 
    trivial; however, I began with research, to save myself some time. Android does not have a built-in equivalent to Shortcuts and 
    personal automations, so that immediately was deflating. I would have to implement it myself, and it seemed more obscure than 
    the code-obfuscation I would have had to do for `five`. So I had the opposite problem: I could switch apps freely, but there was no clear 
    way to go about having the app be triggered on the opening of the desired app without rewriting the entire Shortcuts infrastructure.
    One future possibility is to make use of existing apps that handle such functionality, like Tasker, but I currently don't use an Android 
    phone, so I don't have a need to do so. It's not clear if the opening of an app constitutes a valid Tasker event either.
