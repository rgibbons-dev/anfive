# anfive
a port of `five` to android

AnFive is an attempt to port the [five](https://github.com/rgibbons-dev/five) app to Android.

Like its namesake and predecessor, there were some stumbling blocks, except this time I had the inverse problem:
opening apps via URL is no issue, but there is no (easy) way to watch for events like the launching of an arbitrary app.

As such, keep an eye on this (and the five) repo, I'll be pivoting to some form of meditation/pomodoro app, so I can make use of the spare parts left behind.
